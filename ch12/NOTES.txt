Author is really sloppy with shellSort (note cap) and shellSort[1|2]

Also the procession of carray(p. 162), carray3 (p. 173), carray4 (p. 175) etc.?

Do we want that?

p. 177 shellsort2 is not in "code" font.

Mergesort in its two minimally different variants is wasteful of the 
reader's time.

Final mergeSort (after integration with CArray) is not numbered, nor
properly formatted in the text.

Note I also left in (but commented out) some class debugging code

Node version does NOT like having swap in the CArray object instead of the various sorting objects.
